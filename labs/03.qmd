Upon the completion of all activities, have your instructor review your work and track your progress to receive full credit.

## HTTP Server

Copy the following code into a file named `http_server.py` on your VM or WSL. Try the copy icon on the top-right of the code block. Fill in the blanks. Run it to start listening for HTTP requests on port `8080`. You can stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

### Starter Code

```{.python filename="http_server.py" code-line-numbers=true }
{{< include 03_http_server.py >}}
```

### Testing

- Use `curl` to test your server: `curl http://localhost:8080/hello`
    - You should see the message "Hello, TCP Client!" in the terminal.

- Use `curl -v` to see the full HTTP response.
- Try other resources like `/`, `/goodbye`, and `/joke`.
- Try an invalid resource like `/invalid` to see the 404 response.

## EECSNet VM Setup

1. VPN to EECSNet by changing the server address to `vpn.eecs.ninja` in your Cisco AnyConnect client. Login with your EECSNet credentials. Username remains the same and initial password is `qwer1234QWER!@#$`. Change it immediately. See [Linux setup guide](https://usma-eecs.github.io/linux-guide/) for more details.
1. [Login to vSphere](https://vcsa1.eecs.net/)
1. Find your VM by navigating the tree on the left and expanding all folders.
1. Click on `Launch Web Console` button and login using your VM credentials: `ubuntu` and `cy350pass`
1. Start a DHCP client by running `sudo dhcpcd` in the terminal
1. Check your VM's IP address with `ip addr`. Note down the address for the Ethernet adapter.

### SSH from Windows (not WSL!)

::: {.callout-note}
Do not run SSH from Ubuntu or WSL on your local machine. WSL cannot access your EECSNet VPN.
:::

From a Windows Terminal (PowerShell), run the following command:

```sh
ssh ubuntu@<VM_IP_ADDRESS> # e.g. ssh ubuntu@10.3.50.123
```

Use your VM password to login. Now you can run commands on your EECSNet VM remotely.

### Passwordless SSH

- On your Windows laptop, open PowerShell and check if you have existing SSH keys:

    ```sh
    cd ~ # go to your home directory
    cd .ssh # go to the .ssh directory within your home directory
    ls # list files in the .ssh directory
    ```

- If you do not have `id_ecdsa.pub` or `id_rsa.pub` files or something similar, generate a new SSH key pair: `ssh-keygen`; press `Enter` twice to accept defaults.

- Grab your public key:

    ```sh
    cat id_ecdsa.pub # or cat id_*.pub
    ```
- Place your public key onto the VM:

    ```sh
    mkdir .ssh
    nano .ssh/authorized_keys
    # paste the public key into the text editor
    # save Ctrl+S
    # exit Ctrl+X
    cat .ssh/authorized_keys # verify the key is there
    ```

- Now attempt to SSH again: `ssh ubuntu@<VM_IP_ADDRESS>`. You should not be prompted for a password this time.

- Optionally, now you can connect your VS Code to your VM using the [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh).

Reminder: In VS Code,  [Features > Chat > Disable AI Features](vscode://settings/chat.disableAIFeatures) to protect yourself from unintentional AI completions!

## netcat (nc)

Try the following with your lab partner. Note down each other's VM IP addresses.

### listen (server)

- Use `nc` (netcat) to create a TCP socket
- Listen on port 12345: `nc -v -l -p 12345`
- Why did you not enter an IP address? Where do you enter it?

### connect (client)

- On the other VM, connect to the socket above: `nc PARTNER_VM_IP_ADDRESS 12345`
- Type a message and hit enter. Can your partner see it?

### send a file from client to server

- On the server:

    ```sh
    nc -v -l -p 23456 > incoming.jpg
    ```

- On the client:

    ```sh
    wget http.cat/404 # get a cat picture from the internet
    nc PARTNER_VM_IP_ADDRESS 23456 < 404 # send it to your partner
    ```

### send a file from server to client

- On the server:

    ```sh
    wget http.cat/404 # get a cat picture from the internet
    nc -v -l -p 34567 < 404
    ```

- On the client:

    ```sh
    nc PARTNER_VM_IP_ADDRESS 34567 > incoming.jpg
    ```

### UDP mode

- Repeat the above steps using UDP instead of TCP by adding `-u` flag to `nc` commands.
- What differences do you notice?
