Regardless of your branch, you will have to interact with and have a basic understanding of Computer Networking. Cyber Operations, the future of warfare. The network is your battlespace–use it to reach out and touch your enemy! This course will give you the necessary fundamentals to be successful in more advanced courses. Understanding and applying networking is an important skill for programmers and other computer or cyber science professionals. Networks are integrated into daily life. Imagine your life without Messenger, World Wide Web, Email, or Social Networks. Understanding these services and the underlying networks enhances your ability to use them easily, reliably, and safely."

The labs are designed to provide hands-on experience with network programming and tools. These labs will be completed during scheduled class time and account for 100 points. You will be authorized to access all course materials during these labs.\n\n\nWPRs\nThere are two WPRs, each worth 125 points. The exams are closed book.  No references allowed except a handwritten double sided one-page (8.5x11in) note sheet in your own handwriting and calculator. The exams will be during the normally scheduled class period. See schedule for when they will occur. These WPRs account for 250 points.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nThere are ten problem sets that involve solving programming and network related problems related to the course material, as well as reviewing packet captures using Wireshark. The problem sets account for 300 points.\n\n\nProgramming Project\nThe term project consists of three milestones that will require incremental development of a web client and server, to include key network functionality. Each milestone will be programmed in Python 3 only. Assignments submitted in any other programming language, including Python 2, will not be accepted.\n\n\nLate Work\nPoints available on an assignment are reduced at a rate of 10% per 24-hour period of lateness.  After 5 days, the assignment receives no credit. If you need an extension, coordinate with your instructor at least 2 days before the assignment is due."

    "text": "Documentation and Acknowledgement of Academic Work\nGive credit where credit is due. All problem sets and projects must be accompanied by appropriate documentation. These assignments are designed to be an individual effort. When assistance is required outside of common knowledge, it must be documented.\n\nAssistance vs. Collaboration:\nAssistance is authorized and includes:  - Getting a verbal answer from another individual about a specific point of confusion. - Having someone help you identify errors in your own solution. - Discussing high level concepts with another person.\nReceiving assistance can be a good learning technique and will not normally result in a lowered grade. If the amount of individual work completed after receiving assistance appears to be less than the preponderance of the effort on the submission, the instructor may assign a reduced grade. Always document any assistance that does not qualify as common knowledge.\nCollaboration is not authorized and includes: - Two or more people working jointly to produce a solution. - Two or more people who each complete part of a homework and then join the parts together for common submissions.\nIf any keystroke or mouse click in your submission was done by another cadet, you have exceeded the limits of assistance and engaged in collaboration. Unlike assistance, collaboration can often circumvent the learning process and will almost certainly result in a lower grade. Collaboration must always be properly and specifically documented to avoid honor violations.\nGraded submissions must include proper documentation as described in the USMA Documentation and Acknowledgement of Academic Work (DAAW). The standard documentation format used in this course is the Council of Science Editors (CSE) Name-Year format. For programming assignments, documentation may be in-line (i.e. commented in code) or as a comment at the top of the code. See the linked example_code.py for clear examples of what well documented code should look like.  Additionally, no credit will be assigned for any work until the Documentation and Acknowledgement of Academic Work has been included in assignment submissions. \nThe following resources (including links at Course Resources) are considered common knowledge for CY350:\n\nMaterial presented during class.\nAssistance received from your instructor.\nAssistance received directly from another current CY350 instructor.\nInformation from the course text or readings.\nInformation from python.org.\nWireshark User’s Guide and man pages."

    "text": "CY350 Course Guidance for the use of Generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT)\nWhen used correctly, Generative AI is a powerful tool to help students gain understanding of the course material. For the purposes of this course, students are authorized to use any Generative AI tools that have a built in “study mode” (or equivalent) that is enabled. When used for programming assignments, students must also follow any assignment specific instructions regarding the use of Generative AI. These instructions will be clearly marked towards the beginning of the assignment instructions, and it is the student’s responsibility to ensure instructions are complied with.\nNote: Interactive Development Environment (IDE) built in tools such as VSCode’s Copilot or Jetbrain’s AI still constitute the use of Generative AI tools even though you may not need to directly prompt them. Such use of these tools is considered collaboration since it is nearly impossible to separate the student’s work from the AI’s work. Therefore, the use of such tools is prohibited for all graded events in this course. It is your responsibility to disable AI features in your IDE prior to beginning any graded event. Any use of these tools still must be appropriately cited just like any other source.\nClick here to disable AI features in VSCode Copilot\nDo not overly rely on Generative AI tools to complete assignments. While these tools can be very helpful in understanding concepts, they often produce incorrect or misleading information. Students in the past have lost significant points on assignments and projects due to blindly trusting the output of Generative AI tools. Your instructor will specifically assess your understanding of the course material, not how well you can prompt an AI tool.\nFor the purposes of this course, Generative AI tools should be considered to be a person when determining whether or not help received constitutes assistance or collaboration. Should your instructor determine that your use of Generative AI tools has crossed into collaboration instead of assistance, your instructor reserves the right to reduce your grade by an appropriate amount."

While there is nothing in the Dean’s guidance that prevents this, anyone choosing to do so should be aware of the following considerations:\n\nThe rules on collaboration apply to the use of tutors as well.\nTutors, regardless of education level, have no previous experience with CY350’s programming assignments.\nBased off of feedback from previous students who employed tutors, the tutors spent the majority of the session trying to understand the assignment requirements and starter code instead of coaching students through how to approach the assignment.\n\nBecause of this, while you may engage the services of an Online Tutor, it is strongly recommended that you instead schedule AI with a current CY350 instructor instead:\n\nYou may request AI with any CY350 instructor.\nYou do not need to coordinate with your instructor prior to requesting AI from another CY350 instructor.\nAssistance received in AI with a CY350 instructor does not require citations nor does it risk your grade."
