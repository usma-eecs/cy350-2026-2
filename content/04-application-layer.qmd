#### Preparation

- $2.1$ Principles of Network Applications

#### Lesson Objectives

- Explain the role of the application layer and how it interfaces with the transport layer via sockets
- Differentiate network-application architectures and analyze tradeoffs
- Describe what constitutes an application-layer protocol
- Explain basic security considerations at the application layer

#### Discussion Plan

- Explain the role of the application layer in the Internet protocol stack and how it interfaces with the transport layer via sockets.
- Differentiate network-application architectures - client–server vs peer-to-peer vs hybrid - and analyze tradeoffs (scalability, fault tolerance, management complexity, performance).
- Define "process" and "socket" and trace how processes use sockets to send/receive messages across the network.
- Map common application requirements (e.g., web browsing, file transfer, streaming, gaming, VoIP) to transport services (reliability, throughput, latency, jitter, security).
- Describe what constitutes an application-layer protocol—message types, message syntax, semantics, and rules of exchange—and interpret a minimal protocol transcript (e.g., request/response).
- Explain basic security considerations at the application layer (confidentiality, integrity, authentication)

#### Exercise

- Use `curl -i` or `netcat` to manually craft HTTP requests and interpret responses.
- Design a tactical chat application: who initiates? who remembers state?
