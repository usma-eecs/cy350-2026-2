#### Preparation

- $1.3$ The Network Core
- $1.4$ Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

#### Lesson Objectives

- Explain the evolution from circuit switching to packet switching
- Describe how frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM) enable shared use of circuits
- Define bandwidth, throughput, and delay (including its components)
- Calculate throughput and delay

#### Exercise

- Use a speed test (e.g. fast.com) to measure network performance; turn on "all metrics"; contrast wired vs wireless.
- Given a network scenario, calculate end-to-end delay and throughput.
- Contention exercise: given multiple users sharing a link, calculate individual throughput and maximum number of users.
