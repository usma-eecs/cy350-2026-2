#### Lesson Objectives

- Explain the role of each layer in the TCP/IP model
- Define network protocol
- Explain how protocol design principles enable networks
- Why abstraction fails under attack or congestion
- Identify network traffic using Wireshark / Wireview

#### Preparation

- $1.1$ What is the Internet?
- $1.5$ Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
- $1.6$ Networks Under Attack
- $1.2$ The Network Edge (skim)
- $1.3$ The Network Core (skim)
- $1.7$ History of Computer Networking and the Internet (skim)

#### Exercise

- Use Wireview to identify layers and protocols in captured traffic.
- Map observed protocols to TCP/IP layers.
- Draw the path of a Signal or Whatsapp message — what must go right?
